# pyhf's application to NumFOCUS for Affiliated Project status

1. Does your project have a contributor Code of Conduct?

Yes

2. What is the name of your project?

pyhf

3. Please provide the url of your project's (primary) repo

https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf

4. Your project's website (if applicable)

https://pyhf.readthedocs.io/

5. Please provide a summary description of your project in a few sentences.

pyhf is a pure-Python library for the building and serialization of statistical models used commonly in high energy physics. It also supports statistical inference powered by n-dimensional array library computational backends, including machine learning libraries that allow for exploitation of automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration for speeding up model fitting.

6. Does your project have a logo?

Yes

7. Please upload a .svg file of your project's logo. A "square" format is best.

8. Your project's Twitter handle or other social media handles/urls:

`@pyhf_`

9. Why do you want your project to join NumFOCUS?This question is required.

The maintainers of pyhf care about creating sustainable open source software for particle physics, as well as the broader scientific community, and contributing to communities with similar goals. The community of projects that NumFOCUS has created is exactly the kind of organization the pyhf team wants to partner with. We look forward to engaging with and learning from the mentorship the NumFOCUS community can provide and we are excited to contribute our skills and experience to the rest of the community.

10. Are you applying for Fiscal Sponsorship or Affiliation?

affiliation

11. How does your project relate to or integrate with the existing ecosystem of NumFOCUS tools?

pyhf uses NumPy and SciPy as core dependencies and uses Matplotlib as an optional dependency for visualization. It builds upon these libraries to provide statistical modeling for a common family of binned probability models in particle physics.

12. Describe how your project furthers the NumFOCUS mission: https://numfocus.org/community/mission

pyhf is part of the Scikit-HEP project which is a community-driven and community-oriented project with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with an ecosystem for data analysis in Python. As part of this effort, pyhf empowers particle physics analysts across experiment and theory with expressive models and performant statistical inference while promoting an open ecosystem of tools.
Additionally, the pyhf's JSON model serialization format has been adopted to openly publish the first full probability models from experiments at the CERN Large Hardon Collider, allowing for theorists and experimentalists to have a fully open shared representation of the model used for final analysis. This has promoted closer collaboration between theorists and experimentalists.
