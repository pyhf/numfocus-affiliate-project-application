> I am happy to report that pyhf has been accepted as an Affiliated Project of NumFOCUS!
>
> Here is some general feedback from the Selection Committee:
>
> "This is a nice project and does almost everything right. I would only recommend not having one of the maintainers as the point of contact for CoC, and having a separate entity/contact point for those issues. It would also be nice for the library to improve its intro sections so that people who are not particle physicists can better understand what the package does.

## Notes

The feedback is mostly summarized in [pyhf Issue #2064](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf/issues/2064).
Though the pyhf dev team will need to make a SVG of the logo as it only exists as a PNG at the moment.
